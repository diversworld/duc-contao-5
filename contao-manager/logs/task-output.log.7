  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires diversworld/contao-calendareditor-bundle ^4.3 -> satisfiable by diversworld/contao-calendareditor-bundle[4.3.4].
    - diversworld/contao-calendareditor-bundle 4.3.4 requires contao/calendar-bundle ~4.13 -> found contao/calendar-bundle[4.13.0, ..., 4.13.50] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (5.3.*).

[93.7MiB/11.64s] <warning>Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.</warning>
