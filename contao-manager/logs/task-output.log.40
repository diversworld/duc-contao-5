  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires diversworld/contao-ducapp-bundle dev-main, found diversworld/contao-ducapp-bundle[1.0] but it does not match the constraint.

[93.1MiB/10.24s] <warning>Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.</warning>
