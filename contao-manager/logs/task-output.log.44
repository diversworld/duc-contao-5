  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires diversworld/contao-ducapp-bundle dev-main, found diversworld/contao-ducapp-bundle[1.0] but it does not match the constraint.
  Problem 2
    - Root composer.json requires danielgausi/contao-calendareditor-bundle dev-main -> satisfiable by danielgausi/contao-calendareditor-bundle[dev-main].
    - danielgausi/contao-calendareditor-bundle dev-main requires hofff/contao-calendarfield ^4.0 -> satisfiable by hofff/contao-calendarfield[4.0.0, 4.0.1].
    - hofff/contao-calendarfield[4.0.0, ..., 4.0.1] require contao/core-bundle ~4.9 -> found contao/core-bundle[4.9.0, ..., 4.13.50] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.

[96.9MiB/12.62s] <warning>Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.</warning>
