  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires danielgausi/contao-calendareditor-bundle ^4.3, found danielgausi/contao-calendareditor-bundle[dev-main] but it does not match the constraint.

[201.5MiB/15.28s] <warning>Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.</warning>
