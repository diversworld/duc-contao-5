  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires danielgausi/contao-calendareditor-bundle 4.3 (exact version match: 4.3, 4.3.0 or 4.3.0.0), found danielgausi/contao-calendareditor-bundle[4.3.3] but it does not match the constraint.

[92.7MiB/10.12s] <warning>Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.</warning>
